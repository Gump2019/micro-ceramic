# micro-ceramic
The microscope was used to take 10,000 partial pictures of ceramics, which were taken from 20 different ceramics in 20 folders, with 500 pictures of each ceramic. We open the same ceramics folder and take out two pictures to do the real test experiment. Or open two different folders to take a picture of each for the false test experiment.
